# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Science Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Basic Python | Project was about how to compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. I look at real Yandex.Music data to test the hypotheses that was provided and compare user behavior for these two cities. |
| 2 | Explatory Data Analysis | My mission was to clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. |
| 3 | Statistical Data Analysis | The project task was to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue in telecom operator Megaline. |
| 4 | Software Development Tools | This project aims to provide you with additional practice on common software engineering tasks. |
| 5 | Integrated Project | You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. |
| 6 | Data Collection and Storage (SQL) | You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. | 
| 7 | Introduction to Machine Learning | Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. |
| 8 | Supervised Learning | Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out itâ€™s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones. |
